1. callback function

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. It is called, or "triggered," once a certain task is completed. For example, when you click a button on a webpage, a callback function might run to handle what happens after the click. It's like giving a set of instructions that will be followed when a specific event happens.


function modifyArray(arr,callback){
    arr.push(100);
    callback();
}

var arr=[1,2,3,4,5];
modifyArray(arr,function(){
    console.log("array has been modified",arr)
})
